Puzzle solver for my kids animal game

This isn't a polished final product but you can run index.html in a browser (http:// not file://). In the code inspector, run this as an example:

```
puzzle.solve(challenge_39)
```

or

```
puzzle.solve([RHINO, RHINO, RHINO, ELEPHANT, ELEPHANT, LION, LION, LION])
```
